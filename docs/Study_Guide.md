class ContractReviewAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        # Base NLP model
        self.nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_lg")
        
        # Specialized legal models
        self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("nlpaueb/legal-bert-base-uncased")
        self.model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("nlpaueb/legal-bert-base-uncased")
        
        # Task-specific pipelines
        self.clause_classifier = pipeline("text-classification", model="legal-bert-contract-clauses")
        self.risk_analyzer = pipeline("text-classification", model="legal-bert-risk-analysis")
        self.summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="legal-bert-summarizer")
```

2. **Contract Analysis Process**:
- Document Processing:
```python
async def process(self, input_data):
    # Extract and analyze clauses
    clauses = await self._extract_clauses(document)
    
    # Analyze each clause
    analyzed_clauses = []
    for clause in clauses:
        analysis = await self._analyze_clause(clause, context)
        analyzed_clauses.append(analysis)
    
    # Generate risk assessment and recommendations
    risks = await self._assess_risks(analyzed_clauses)
    compliance_issues = await self._check_compliance(analyzed_clauses, context)
```

3. **Clause Extraction and Classification**:
```python
async def _extract_clauses(self, document):
    # Split document into sections
    doc = self.nlp(document)
    sections = self._split_into_sections(doc)
    
    clauses = []
    for section in sections:
        # Classify clause type
        clause_type = self.clause_classifier(section.text)[0]
        
        # Extract key terms
        terms = self._extract_terms(section)
        
        clause = ContractClause(

        risk_pred = self.risk_analyzer(clause_analysis['clause']['text'])[0]
        
        # Calculate risk score
        risk_score = self.risk_scorer.calculate_score(
            risk_pred['label'],
            risk_pred['score'],
            clause_analysis['risk_factors']

        # Calculate risk score
        risk_score = self.risk_scorer.calculate_score(
            risk_pred['label'],
            risk_pred['score'],
            clause_analysis['risk_factors']

- Access control

The system maintains compliance through:

1. **Proactive Monitoring**:
- Regular regulatory checks
- Automated updates
- Impact assessments
- Document analysis

2. **Automated Updates**:
- Rule updates
- Document modifications
- Compliance checks
- Notification system

3. **Audit Trail**:
- Event logging
- Change tracking
- Compliance history
- Document versioning

This comprehensive approach ensures that legal documents remain compliant with current regulations while maintaining a complete audit trail of all changes and compliance checks.
------------------------------------------------
Now let me explain how the real-time alerts work in this system:

1. **Document Compliance Check Process**:
   - When a document is created or modified, the system calls `check_compliance()` in the `ComplianceChecker`
   - The checker evaluates the document against applicable rules for the jurisdiction
   - If any compliance issues are found (`not check.is_compliant`), it triggers the notification process

2. **Notification Generation**:
   - The `_send_compliance_notifications()` method groups violations by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
   - For each severity group with violations, it creates a notification with:
     - Unique ID (UUID)
     - Type (compliance_issue)
     - Severity level
     - Message describing the number and severity of issues
     - Detailed information about the violations

3. **Real-time Delivery**:
   - The notification service maintains WebSocket connections for each active user
   - When a notification is created:
     - It's stored in the `notification_store` for persistence
     - It's immediately sent to all active WebSocket connections for the target user
     - Failed connections are automatically cleaned up

4. **Frontend Display**:
   - The `NotificationCenter` component maintains a WebSocket connection to receive notifications
   - When a notification arrives:
     - It's added to the top of the notification list
     - The unread count is incremented
     - A badge shows the number of unread notifications
     - Notifications are color-coded by severity
     - Clicking a notification marks it as read and navigates to the relevant document

5. **Error Handling and Reliability**:
   - WebSocket connection failures are handled gracefully
   - Failed notifications don't block the compliance check process
   - Disconnected clients are automatically cleaned up
   - Notifications are persisted and can be retrieved when a user reconnects

6. **Security**:
   - All API endpoints require authentication
   - WebSocket connections are authenticated
   - Notifications are only delivered to the intended recipients
   - System permissions are verified for broadcast notifications

The implementation includes proper error handling, logging, and configuration management. The main improvements made were:
1. Added proper error handling and logging throughout the notification process
2. Made the notification service URL configurable through environment variables
3. Added cleanup of disconnected WebSocket connections
4. Improved error handling for WebSocket operations
5. Added logging for better debugging and monitoring

The system provides immediate feedback to users about compliance issues while maintaining reliability and security.
